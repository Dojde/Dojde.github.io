<h2 style="font-size:30px;">FINN INN</h2>
<blockquote style="font-size: 14px;">Waiter, 2016-present</blockquote>
<span style="font-size: 16px; line-height: normal;">
Finn Inn is a resturant located in Lund where I have been working as a part-time waiter during my studies.
</span>

##### Communication
<span style="font-size: 16px; line-height: normal;">
Being able to communicate well is probably one of the most important skills a waiter must learn. We must be able to communicate with both guests, 
hosts and coleagues. We must be polite even during stressfull situation and try to satisfy everyones needs.
</span>

###### Long demanding shifts 
<span style="font-size: 16px; line-height: normal;">
As a waiter you are usually working before, during and after an event. This results in long demanding shifts where one often is expected to work late hours.
</span>

###### Planning, structure and adaptability 
<span style="font-size: 16px; line-height: normal;">
A big part of executing a successfull event comes down to good planning and being able to adapt to unforeseen situations. 
What do you do when there are more guests than expected? Or if someone the break at an seminarium is half an hour too early?
To handle these situations well you must have a good structure, good communication within the team and a solution oriented approach. 
</span>

<h2 style="font-size:30px;">AXIS Communications</h2>
<blockquote style="font-size: 14px;">Assistant to engineers, 2016-2018</blockquote>
<span style="font-size: 16px; line-height: normal;">
Axis Communications develops network cameras for video surveillance. 
I was working as an assistant to a group of engineers and had a wide range of tasks, from automation of tests to collecting video material. 
</span>

###### Improved Technical Knowledge
<span style="font-size: 16px; line-height: normal;">
During my years at Axis my technical knowledge was furthered. I was creating scripts that were reviewed and used by the engineers at Axis which helped me 
improve my ability in programming. A few example of completed tasks are
</span>

<ul style="font-size: 16px; line-height: normal;">
<li>Automation of radar measurements including components such as step motors and spectrum analyzers </li>
<li>Development and automation of the lab systems used by many departments at Axis </li>
<li>Development of software used for collecting video material and changing camera settings </li>
<li>A comparative study to investigate differences in sales figures</li>
</ul>

###### Working as an engineer
<span style="font-size: 16px; line-height: normal;">
I got a first hand experince of how the engineers were working and the workflows used at Axis. I learned about the methodologies they use to solve problems,
how I could facilitate their work and how to communicate in a good manner.
</span>

###### Software development in groups 
<span style="font-size: 16px; line-height: normal;">
Many of my projects were performed with other part-time workers through which I learned how to tackle coordination and communication in software development. 
</span>

<h2 style="font-size:30px;">Tetra Pak</h2>
<blockquote style="font-size: 14px;">Warehouse worker, 2015</blockquote>
<span style="font-size: 16px; line-height: normal;">
During the summer of 2015 I performed warehouse work at Tetra Pak Technical Service Ab. 
My main task was to count and collect spareparts which should be sent to customers. 
</span>

###### Performing the given task with excellence
<span style="font-size: 16px; line-height: normal;">
During the summer I packaged thousans of order lines with very few errors. When the summer ended it was concluded that I had been one of the workers in
my shift who had collected the most order lines while still having a lower margin error than was allowed for.
</span>

###### Discipline
<span style="font-size: 16px; line-height: normal;">
During the summer of 2015 I worked at Tetra Pak every week of my summer vacation. We often began our shift at 6:00am.
