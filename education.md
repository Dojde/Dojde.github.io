My master of science in Industrial Engineering and Management at the Faculty of Engineering, Lund University, includes multiple courses from both Software Intensive Systems and Risk Management (Statistics).

## Software Intensive Systems 
Within this master I have read a couple of more technical courses such as 
- Object-Oriented Modelling and Design 
- Algorithms, data structures and complexity
- Real time programming
- Simulation 
- Database Technology

Except for the more technical courses I have also taken courses which are more focused on the software development process.
- Software Development for Large Systems
- Configuration Management 
- Software Engineering - Methodology

## Risk Management (Statistics)
From this master (which officically is called Financial Engineering and Risk Management) I have extracted the following statistic courses. 
- Stationary Stochastic Processes
- Mathematical Statistics, Time Series Analysis
- Monte Carlo and Empirical Methods for Stochastic Inference
