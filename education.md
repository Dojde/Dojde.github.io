<span style="font-size: 16px; line-height: normal;">
Since software devlopment was a very small part of my course plan I often studied courses in software development in addition to the regular courses. I have taken software courses such as
<ul style="font-size: 16px;">
 <li>Software Development for Large Systems</li>
 <li>Object-Oriented Modelling and Design  </li>
 <li>Algorithms, Data Structures and Complexity  </li>
 <li>Real Time Programming </li>
 <li>Database Technology   </li>
 <li>Simulation  </li>
 <li>Configuration Management  </li>
 <li>Software Engineering - Methodology </li>
</ul>  

## Mathematics
<span style="font-size: 16px; line-height: normal;">
Industrial Engineering is one of the engineering programs which requires most courses on the subject of mathematics. Additionally, my master was mainly composed of courses in statitics. Example of courses in mathematics are
<ul style="font-size: 16px;">
 <li>Monte Carlo and empirical methods for stochastic inference </li>
 <li>Mathematical Statistics, Time Series Analysis  </li>
 <li>Stationary Stochastic Processes </li>
 <li>Analytic Functions  </li>
 <li>Calculus in One Variable </li>
 <li>Calculus in Serveral Variables </li>
 <li>Statistics Basic Cous  </li>
 <li>Linear Algebra</li>
</ul>

<ul style="font-size: 16px;">
 <li>Project Management Knowledge Areas, 15 credits</li>
 <li>Internet Based Introduction to Law with Multimedia Lectures, 15 credits</li>
 <li>Rhetoric, 15 credits  </li>
