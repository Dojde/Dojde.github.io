## Website for Workout Registering

## Water Pump
Since I got tired of giving water to my tomatoes and since they limited the amount of time one could spend away from home i decided to build a watering system for my plants. I used an esp as an client which controlled the pump and gained expreinse with soldering, relay cards, circut diagrams and much more. As a challenge I decided to implement the server side from scratch which included buliding an server with express which communicated with the esp through an mqtt broker, logged the values with InfluxDB, presented infomation with grafana and automated the watering with node-red.

## Haskell Algorithms 

## Literature 
My favourite genre is non-fiction. I deeply appreciate a well-written book which manages to explain the underlying reason of why things are as they are and presents new perspectives on everyday things. Therefore, some of my favourite subjects to read about in my sparetime have been psychology and behavioral economics. 
 
## Engagement in local handball team
Through my youth I was a engaged in both the local handball and fotball team. Later, I returned to handball in the role of responsible for a youth teams physical training. This was a role I held for over 4 years and had the luxuray to be a part of an incredibly competent group of coaches. With good structure, lots of engagement and many hours of ward work we became the largest team in our age category and managed to have all 3 of our teams to be a part of the last 32 teams standing in the Swedish Championship. Something which had never been done before.

This engagement resulted in many hours of contemplating and learning about how I could best contribute to the development of the players. I took multiple courses, planned countless workout-sessions and developed a website (https://hjhulugi.wordpress.com/) where the players could take part of my thoughts regarding exercise, sleep, nutriton and mental aspects.
