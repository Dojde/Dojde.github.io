# Welcome! 

#### I'm glad that you found your way to my portfolio. Here you can learn more [about me]({% link about.md %}).

## Education
Currently I am performing my master in which I combine: 
1. Software Intensive Systems - Example courses: Software Development for Large Systems and Configuration management
2. Risk Management (Statistics) - Example courses: Stationary Stochastic Processes and Time Series Analysis.  

## Private projects
I have been doing some own projects too. Maybe I can interest you in a water pump for my tomatoes? Or how about some algorithms common CS-related problem written in [haskell]({% link _posts/2020-12-12-haskell-algorithms.md %})? Or would you rather want to see a website for register workouts?
