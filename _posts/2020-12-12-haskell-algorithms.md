# Algorithms in Haskell

Haskell is a purely functional programming language. Learing haskell requires one to change the way of thinking about programming and adapt a new paradigm.

I have used haskell to solve a few common CS-problems which can be found in this [repo](https://github.com/Dojde/haskell-algorithms.git).
