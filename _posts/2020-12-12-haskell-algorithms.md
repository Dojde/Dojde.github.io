# My journey into the wonderful world of haskell

Haskell is a purely functional programming language. Learing haskell requires one to change the way of thinking about programming and adapt a new paradigm.

At first the experience is frustrating since even the simplest of things feel troublesome to implement. But as one continous to learn about curried functions, functors and monads, the experince is quite rewarding. Haskell and functional programming has given me a new perspective on programming.

[Here is a repo](https://github.com/Dojde/haskell-algorithms.git) is a small sample of some common CS-problems which I have used haskell to solve.
