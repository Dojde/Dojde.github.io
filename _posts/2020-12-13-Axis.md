# Axis Communications

Axis Communication develops network cameras for video surveillance. 
I was working as an assistant to a group of engineers and had a wide range of tasks, from automation of tests to collecting video material. 

## Improved Technical Knowledge
During my years at Axis my technical knowledge was furthered. I was creating scripts that were reviewed and used by the engineers at Axis which helped me 
improve my ability in programming. A few example of completed tasks are:
- Automation of radar measurements including components such as step motors and spectrum analyzers. 
- Development and automation of the lab systems used by many departments at Axis. 
- Development of software used for collecting video material and changing camera settings.
- A comparative study to investigate differences in sales figures.

## Insight in the work of an engineer
I got a first hand experince of how the engineers were working and the workflows used at Axis. I learned about the methodologies they use to solve problems,
how I could facilitate their work and how to communicate in a good manner.

## Software development in groups 
Many of my projects were performed with other part-time workers through which I learned how to tackle coordination and communication in software development.
