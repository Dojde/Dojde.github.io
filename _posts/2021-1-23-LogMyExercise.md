# LogMyExercise

LogMyExercise is a private project which I have been working on during the last year.
The idea is to create a service where one can log all their exercises of different types and set up goals.
The idea is to have a clear focus on the possiblity of creating groups, common goals and get collective statistic.

It is developed with django for the back-end. For the frontend development react is used and a rest framework is used for communication.
Although this project currently is a work in progress it has allowed me to focus and improve understanding of different aspects in software development. 

It has given me an insight both of how a good workflow is designed and multiple aspects of developing a web-service, such as databases and different frameworks.
