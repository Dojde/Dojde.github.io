# Time series analysis

The aim of this course was to give practical and theoretical knowledge in modelling, 
estimation, validation, prediction, and interpolation of time discrete dynamical stochastic systems, mainly linear systems. 
It covered mathematical modeling of time varying phenomena. 
For additional information about exact course content the course syllabus can be found [here](https://kurser.lth.se/kursplaner/20_21%20eng/FMSN45.html).

Besides from lectures and exercises a large part of the course was a project where a time serie should be analyzed.
Our task was to investigate how to model a power load with two input data series. This was done through the Box-Jenkins model. The parameters 
where both estimated with the prediction error method and recursively estimated with a kalman filter. 

## Main takeaways
This course provided insight to how one can use statistical theorems and models to analyze, model and predict a time serie.
One got to both learn the theoretical aspects but also practically try to apply the knowledge obtained.
Additionally, when one can trust models, how to assess them and how one could go about improving them was discussed.
