The system was mainly composed of a step motor and a specturm analyzer. A user interface was created which allowed the user to quickly customize settings. Additionally, the user was able to write and run self-designed, customizable program through a short entrance in a yaml file. After measurements was done the data was analyzed an displayed automatically which saved the user lots of valuable time. This project was well recived and I even employees working outside my department told me they used it.

Together with a co-worker I performed a comparative stude with the purpose of explaining differences in sales. We analyzed to products from aspects such as value to a segmentaion, price, placement in portfolio and more. This was a perfect opportunity to use my broad set of skills and analyze the situation both from a technical, marketing and psychological perspective. The final work was very well recived and praied by multiple engineers at Axis.

<span style="font-size: 16px; line-height: normal;">
At Axis Communications I performed automation of lab equipment which include multiple tasks such as automatically detecting which the manufacture of a camera was and create pre-defined programs in purpose of measuring certain features. This project gave me a chance to practice understanding and working with a fairly large, previous existing code base.

One common work task when I was working at Axis Communications was to record video material. To facilitate this work me, and my co-workers, created a script which automated the recordings and had a user interface in which one could easily change the settings. The script saved us countless of hours and made our days a lot more fun.
