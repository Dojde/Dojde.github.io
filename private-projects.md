## Litterature 
My favourite genre is non-fiction. I deeply appreciate a well-written book which manages to explain the underlying reason of why things are as they are and presents new perspectives on everyday things. Therefore, some of my favourite subjects to read about in my sparetime have been psychology and behavioral economics. 
 
## Engagement in local handball team
Through my youth I was a engaged in both the local handball and fotball team. Later, I returned to handball in the role of responsible for a youth teams physical training. This was a role I held for over 4 years and had the luxuray to be a part of an incredibly competent group of coaches. With good structure, lots of engagement and many hours of ward work we became the largest team in our age category and managed to have all 3 of our teams to be a part of the last 32 teams standing in the Swedish Championship. Something which had never been done before.

This engagement resulted in many hours of contemplating and learning about how I could best contribute to the development of the players. I took multiple courses, planned countless workout-sessions and developed a website (https://hjhulugi.wordpress.com/) where the players could take part of my thoughts regarding exercise, sleep, nutriton and mental aspects.
