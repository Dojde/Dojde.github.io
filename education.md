## Mathematics
<span style="font-size: 16px; line-height: normal;">
Industrial Engineering is one of the engineering programs which requires most courses on the subject of mathematics. Additionally, my master was mainly composed of courses in statitics. 
From this master (which officically is called Financial Engineering and Risk Management) I have extracted the following statistic courses.
- Calculus in One and Serveral Variables
- Linear Algebra
- Statistics Basic Cous
- Analytic Functions
- System and Transforms
- Stationary Stochastic Processes
- Mathematical Statistics, Time Series Analysis
- Monte Carlo and Empirical Methods for Stochastic Inference
