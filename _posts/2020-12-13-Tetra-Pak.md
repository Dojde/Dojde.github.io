# Tetra Pak Technical Service Ab

During the summer of 2015 I performed warehouse work at Tetra Pak Technical Service Ab. 
My main task was to count and collect spareparts which should be sent to customers. 

## Performing the given task with excellence
During the summer I packaged thousans of order lines with very few errors. When the summer ended it was concluded that I had been one of the workers in
my shift who had collected the most order lines while still having a lower margin error than was allowed for.

## Discipline
During the summer of 2015 I worked at Tetra Pak every week of my summer vacation. We often began our shift at 6:00am.
