# About me

###### On this page follows a short description of what engages me. It is written in the purpose of you getting a better understanding of how I am as a person. 

### Litterature 
My favourite genre is non-fiction. I deeply appreciate a well-written book which manages to explain the underlying reason of why things are as they are and presents new perspectives on everyday things. Therefore, some of my favourite subjects to read about in my sparetime have been psychology and behavioral economics.

### Exercise
Running, padel and biking are a few examples of sports that I love to practice. Through my youth I was a engaged in both the local handball and fotball team. Later, I returned to handball in the role of responsible for a youth teams physical training. This was a role I held for over 4 years and had the luxuray to be a part of an incredibly competent group of coaches. With good structure, lots of engagement and many hard working players we became the largest team in our age category, managed to have all 3 of our teams to the second be a part of the last 32 teams standing. Something which had never been done before.
